Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT’s current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%–2.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we ﬁnd that this share could actually be between 2.1% and 3.9%. For ICT’s future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts’ projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and ﬁnd that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector’s footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.}, number={9}, journal={Patterns}, author={Freitag, Charlotte and Berners-Lee, Mike and Widdicks, Kelly and Knowles, Bran and Blair, Gordon S. and Friday, Adrian}, year={2021}, month=sep, pages={100340}, language={en}

          , 
            
              Data centers represent the information backbone of an increasingly digitalized world. Demand for their services has been rising rapidly (
              1
              ), and data-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous vehicles promise to increase demand further (
              2
              ). Given that data centers are energy-intensive enterprises, estimated to account for around 1% of worldwide electricity use, these trends have clear implications for global energy demand and must be analyzed rigorously. Several oft-cited yet simplistic analyses claim that the energy used by the world’s data centers has doubled over the past decade and that their energy use will triple or even quadruple within the next decade (
              3
              –
              5
              ). Such estimates contribute to a conventional wisdom (
              5
              ,
              6
              ) that as demand for data center services rises rapidly, so too must their global energy use. But such extrapolations based on recent service demand growth indicators overlook strong countervailing energy efficiency trends that have occurred in parallel (see the first figure). Here, we integrate new data from different sources that have emerged recently and suggest more modest growth in global data center energy use (see the second figure). This provides policy-makers and energy analysts a recalibrated understanding of global data center energy use, its drivers, and near-term efficiency potential.}, number={6481}, journal={Science}, author={Masanet, Eric and Shehabi, Arman and Lei, Nuoa and Smith, Sarah and Koomey, Jonathan}, year={2020}, month=feb, pages={984–986}, language={en}
