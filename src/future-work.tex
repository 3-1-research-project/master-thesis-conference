\section{Future Work}

Future research can build upon our findings regarding how optimization impacts the energy consumption of web applications.

The next step would be to investigate how different combinations of optimizations impact energy consumption. If possible, it would be beneficial to conduct a thorough combinatorial test of multiple optimizations and their impact on each implementation. We expect that some optimizations complement or counteract each other, which could impact energy consumption.

Other approaches would be to target how the scenario impacts the experiment. This could be explored by randomizing the order of inputs from the client's scenario or base the scenario on real usage data, to avoid the application optimizing for repetitive tasks. 

Since the quality of the implementations used for the experiments may vary, one approach could be to collect multiple different implementations written in the same programming language and framework. This would enable the exploration of how the specific implementation, specifically the actual written code, affects the energy consumption of the application.
